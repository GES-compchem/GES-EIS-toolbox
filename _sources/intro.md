# GES-EIS-toolbox Documentation

Version: [0.0.1a](release-notes)

The `GES-EIS-toolbox` library is a small collection of tools for the manipulation and analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data based around the [impedance.py](https://impedancepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) library. The library allows to simulate, load and organize EIS data in order to provide a natural interface to machine-learning applications .
